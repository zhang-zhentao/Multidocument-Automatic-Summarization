Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific  leaders ``difficult'' because of his concerns about the arrest of  Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported  Sunday. She said authorities have denied lawyers access to her husband,  and asked: ``How are they going to prepare for his defense?'' He later said he would attend the summit and had  only made the earlier remarks out of sympathy toward Anwar. Anwar is a charismatic politician  who was once picked to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
