Summary for topic d30046t:
For, with the impeachment issue set to move to the Senate,  Livingston, whose own marital indiscretions were now before the public  to his obvious misery, chose to show how the question of a political  leader's resignation was very much in play in this tumult-tossed city. ``We are here to debate impeachment and should not  be distracted from that,'' he declared. His spokesman,  Joe Lockhart, said, ``The president has no intention of resigning.'' Livingston and his right-wing colleagues, the Tom DeLays, the Henry  Hydes, the Bob Barrs, were on a mission of destruction and would not  be denied. Party lines on Saturday's rolls calls held as firm  as leg irons.
