Summary for topic d30037t:
An-Nahar's columnist, Sahar Baasiri,  said in a front-page comment: `The mere announcement that he (Sharon)  will lead negotiations (with Arabs) is tantamount to disaster.'' Since the 1982  invasion, Israel has been mired in an unpopular open-ended occupation  of southern Lebanon, an operation with constant casualties among young  inductees for which Sharon is still often blamed. In civilian life he proved as savvy  a political operator as he was a military strategist, helping to break  Labor's hold on the Knesset and making himself an indispensable binding  force within successive fractious Likud coalitions.
