Summary for topic d31050t:
Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared to be an attempt by  the government to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcoming  trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli. The emphasis on  stability and warnings to those who would disrupt it were reminiscent  of party pronouncements in the waning years of Jiang's mentor, Deng  Xiaoping. Qin and a third principal organizer,  Wang Youcai, were also denied legal counsel. The punishment of a third veteran  democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, has not been announced. Despite the swift punishments given the three, dissidents  have continued to campaign for justice.
