Summary for topic d30051t:
``Once Goran  Jelisic even declined assistance from a guard, noting that he was  still in `good form' even though he had killed over 60 people,'' Bowers  told judges, citing statements made by witnesses due to testify later  in the trial. Although most victims  were men, Jelisic also clubbed one female inmate with a police baton  and then fatally shot her. In other Kosovo massacres, bodies had been  moved from the sites before they were seen by independent observers. Krstic  was a colonel in 1995, and the deputy commander of the Drina battalion,  but was promoted to general within days of the fall of Srebrenica.
