Even before  the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic  commerce software and services. Since then, Netscape  has focused mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction  fees from its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software  to corporations that are building their own Internet sites on which  to conduct electronic commerce. In addition, for consumers  who do not subscribe to AOL's dial-up service, it also has its own  Web site, aol.com, which attracts about 24 million visitors a month,  according to Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, a market research firm.
