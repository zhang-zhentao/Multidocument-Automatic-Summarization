``Italy knows what the  fate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he falls into the hands of the  Turkish military regime,'' said an editorial Saturday in the Greek  daily Eleftherotypia. Earlier this month, a bloc of  109 lawmakers in the 300-member parliament issued an invitation for  Ocalan to visit Greece. A group of  more than 100 Kurds began a three-day fast in a downtown Athens square  Saturday in support of Ocalan. He was also to deliver a speech to the Foreign  Policy Society later Tuesday. In a news  conference Monday, D'Alema recognized the extent of the problem.
