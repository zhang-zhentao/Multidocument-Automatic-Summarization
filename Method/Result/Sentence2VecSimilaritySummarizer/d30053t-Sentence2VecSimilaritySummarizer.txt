Summary for topic d30053t:
Palestinians see the Clinton  trip as implicit recognition of their struggle for statehood, even  though Clinton has specifically said in an interview aired on Israel's  Channel 2 television that it should not be read that way. Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the Palestinians  say only approval by acclamation is required. Netanyahu maintains he never agreed to free  those with ``blood on their hands.'' However, Netanyahu has said the PNC never completed  the job. ``Israel never promised to release murders at  Wye, and it won't release them.''
