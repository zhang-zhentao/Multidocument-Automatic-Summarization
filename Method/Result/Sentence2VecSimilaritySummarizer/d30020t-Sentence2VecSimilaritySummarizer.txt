Thailand won  host rights for the quadrennial games in 1995, but setbacks in preparations  led officials of the Olympic Council of Asia late last year to threaten  to move the games to another country. ``As a host, surely the melee will  have an impact on the image and reputation of Thailand,'' said Santiparb  Tejavanija, chairman of the administrative committee. According  to regulations, all participating horses had to be screened for a  number of diseases before arriving in Thailand. The plea to reconsider  was made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic  Council of Asia.
