Summary for topic d31013t:
Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who led efforts to  overturn the old abortion law and whose Toronto clinic was bombed  in 1993, says he and his colleagues are sacrificing personal freedom  as they reluctantly increase security measures. The government  has been urged to make a public appeal to drug companies, but the  health department says this can't be done. Both faced misdemeanor charges after blocking a Burlington,  Vt., health clinic in 1990 that Kopp called ``the mill.''
