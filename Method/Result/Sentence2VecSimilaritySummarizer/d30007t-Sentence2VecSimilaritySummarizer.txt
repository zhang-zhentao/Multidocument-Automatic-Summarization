Mondo said he  was expecting air shipments of munitions to bolster the rebel offensive. The rebels have promised  to revitalize the economy by reducing taxes to boost investment. The silence of their march was interrupted only  by the singing of crickets and the clanging of the bullet belts hanging  around the soldiers' necks.
