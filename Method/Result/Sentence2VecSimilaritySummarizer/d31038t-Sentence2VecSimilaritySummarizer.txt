Summary for topic d31038t:
Bin Laden, believed  to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were indicted Wednesday by a  U.S. District Court in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and are  accused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the United States. The Taliban have refused  to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there  is evidence they will try him under Islamic law. Saqib said his inquiry will  wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the  case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban. The indictment does not, for example, specify  whether prosecutors have evidence that bin Laden gave direct orders  to those who carried out the attacks.
