Summary for topic d30031t:
This was the first time in three  years, and 19 flights, that a shuttle countdown had been stopped after  the spaceship was fueled and the crew aboard the craft and ready to  go. The two station pieces are so  big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined  mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her crewmates were going to  have to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather  than direct line of sight. Stacking the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the Earth was considered  the most difficult part of the mission.
