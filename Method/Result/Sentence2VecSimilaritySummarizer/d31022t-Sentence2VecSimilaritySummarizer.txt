Summary for topic d31022t:
As investigators  worked to find the cause, examiners identified another 22 of the bodies,  bringing the total to 40, and officials said 49 people were released  from hospital. Earlier in the day, Noren had said it was a ''50-50'' chance that  the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that authorities had  tracked down new clues. Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed  off that figure Friday evening. The fire's quick spread  has prompted speculation that it could have been set, but officials  also say the explosive spread could have been because the fire had  been burning undetected for some time.
