Summary for topic d30055t:
Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless  his new government could stick to the policies of its old one, an  unlikely scenario given the divided Parliament. Or he could seek to form a new majority without  the Communists by seeking an alliance with the small center-right  party of Francesco Cossiga. Prodi's government has held together  this long in large part because of the widely shared desire to see  Italy qualify for the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the  euro. That happened earlier this year  _ leaving the disparate allies without so clear a reason to stay together.
