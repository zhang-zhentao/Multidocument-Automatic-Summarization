Summary for topic d30038t:
Marc Hodler, a senior member  of the International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractices  in the bid campaigns for the games of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002. Pound  said the panel would investigate allegations that ``there may or may  not have been payments for the benefit of members of the IOC or their  families connected with the Salt Lake City bid.'' Asked whether  he regretted his statements Sunday, Hodler said, ``Not at all'' and  later said that ``the cities have been the victims and not the villains.'' John Krimsky,  deputy secretary general of the U.S. Olympic Committee, disputed Hodler's  assertion.
