Summary for topic d30015t:
In a widely anticipated report to the Security  Council, Annan listed apparent violations of a Sept. 23 U.N. resolution,  decried the ``appalling atrocities in Kosovo,'' and said it was ``clear  beyond any reasonable doubt'' that Yugoslav forces were responsible  for the bulk of them. Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic,  Montenegro, called on Milosevic to accept all international demands  and avert a NATO attack. The interior ministry  police must also reduce their presence around villages so that refugees  who have fled have the confidence to return, the military officer  said.
