Summary for topic d30045t:
Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two largest oil companies, confirmed  Friday that they were discussing a possible merger, and antitrust  lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predicted that  any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such  a new corporate behemoth. Though Mobil and Exxon might have  high concentrations of gas stations in certain areas of the United  States, analysts say they have far more competition at the pump than  before oil prices collapsed in the 1980s.
