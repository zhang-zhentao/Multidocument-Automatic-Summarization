Summary for topic d30042t:
Al Thani handed Gadhafi a letter that reaffirmed Qatar's  support for Libya ``in its just position toward the so-called Lockerbie  case,'' the television said, referring to Libya's objections to the  U.N. sanctions imposed in 1992 to press it to hand over two Libyans  wanted for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish  town of Lockerbie that left 270 people dead. The council has agreed to suspend the sanctions  once Libya turns the men over for a trial by Scottish judges according  to Scottish law in the Netherlands, under a U.S.-British proposal.
