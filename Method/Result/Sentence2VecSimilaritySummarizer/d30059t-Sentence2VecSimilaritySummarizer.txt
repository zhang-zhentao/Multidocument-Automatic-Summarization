Summary for topic d30059t:
Friends and relatives say Mrs. Staravoitova, a founder of Russia's  democratic movement, had received death threats, but the motive for  the killing remains unclear. ``She had too  many enemies,'' said Galina Markelova, an aide to the lawmaker. Afterward, Galina Starovoitova was to be buried alongside  some of Russia's greatest national heroes. There was, in much of the reaction to Starovoitova's death,  the sense that a line had been crossed. Most of the  killings involve business deals and the corruption that has swamped  the government and the economy. Yet, as remarkable as that  news was, it has been vastly overshadowed by the death of Starovoitova.
