Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put  off a vote to ratify the accord after a suicide bombing Friday in  Jerusalem that killed the two assailants and injured 21 Israelis. The two bombers were identified as Youssef Zughayer,  21, from Anata, near Jerusalem, and his brother-in-law, Suleiman Tahayneh,  24, from Silat al-Harithiya, near the West Bank town of Jenin. After a while, we heard a blast, and something hit  me in the stomach,'' said Cohen who was treated for minor injuries  at Hadassah Hospital. ``There  was hysteria, people were running,'' said Eliad Duan, an Israeli border  policeman who was patrolling the market and was lightly injured.
