Summary for topic d30005t:
Administration  officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill  bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors  with leading a global war against U.S. interests. It is not  clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded  to bin Laden. ``I either heard these statements myself,'' the source  said, ``or I read them or learned of them from other al Qaeda members.'' Targeting infrastructure,  officials acknowledged, can also mean destroying the leadership of  a terrorist group. A 1976 executive order  bars anyone working for the U.S. government from plotting or carrying  out assassinations.
