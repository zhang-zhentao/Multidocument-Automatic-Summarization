Summary for topic d30047t:
``Now we only have 44 launches to go, about  1,000 hours of space walks and countless problems, but because of  the trust and mutual respect ... the international space station is  going to be a reality,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference  after the launch. The only other problem  was with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement part. The two station  pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the  other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her  crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views,  rather than direct line of sight.
