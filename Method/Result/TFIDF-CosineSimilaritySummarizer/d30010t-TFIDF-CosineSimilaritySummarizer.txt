Summary for topic d30010t:
The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for  the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market and promised more  attacks to try to block the new peace accord. Groundbreaking there in March 1997 led to a break-off in negotiations  with the Palestinians. ``This heroic operation  is not the first and not going to be the last,'' the group said in  a leaflet faxed to news organizations. ``We refuse any political agreement  that would recognize the Zionist enemy.''
