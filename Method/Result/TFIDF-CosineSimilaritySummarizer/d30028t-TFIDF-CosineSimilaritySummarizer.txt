``We have taken steps  to reassure Syria.'' Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President  Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey. Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering  Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy  for the Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey. For its  part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with  Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining  position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
