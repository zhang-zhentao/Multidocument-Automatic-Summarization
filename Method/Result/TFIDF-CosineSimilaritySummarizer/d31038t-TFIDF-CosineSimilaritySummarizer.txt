Summary for topic d31038t:
Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan  under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement  that rules that country. A nearly simultaneous attack in neighboring  Kenya killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, at the U.S. Embassy  in Nairobi. The United States retaliated Aug. 20, firing  Tomahawk cruise missiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in  eastern Afghanistan. All three have pleaded innocent. Police and soldiers on Friday blocked off the street in front of a  house where members of a terrorist gang are believed to have assembled  the bomb that blew up the U.S. Embassy, killing 11 people.
