Summary for topic d31032t:
The president insists he  has no major health problems and will serve out the remaining two  years of his term. Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems,  including quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago, so whenever  he gets sick there is a flurry of speculation about his ability to  function. A respiratory  infection forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this  week. Yeltsin appeared stiff  and stumbled during another public ceremony after he arrived in Tashkent,  the capital of this Central Asian nation, and had to be supported  by Uzbek President Islam Karimov.
