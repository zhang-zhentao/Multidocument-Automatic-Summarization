Summary for topic d30037t:
Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves  as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official  Syrian newspaper said Saturday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner  in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him indirectly  responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by  Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps.
