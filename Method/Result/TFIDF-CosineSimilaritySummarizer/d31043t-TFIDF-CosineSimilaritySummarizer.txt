The new president must be sworn  in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office at the end of his six-year  term. Lahoud,  62, commander of Lebanon's army who was propelled to power with widespread  popular backing, pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up  the graft-riddled administration. Hariri is credited with  restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. Lahoud's nomination complies  with a tradition that the president be a Maronite Christian, the prime  minister a Sunni Muslim and Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim.
