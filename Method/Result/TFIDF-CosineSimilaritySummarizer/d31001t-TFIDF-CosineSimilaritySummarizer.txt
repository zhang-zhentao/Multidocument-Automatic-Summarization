Summary for topic d31001t:
De Kock has applied for amnesty for his crimes. The Truth and  Reconciliation Commission will release its final report on 2 1-2 years  of investigation on Thursday. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalists  in Pretoria he had heard the news report, but would not comment. Former  President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans to ask a court to prevent  the Truth Commission report from implicating him in covering up state-sponsored  terror. ``Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court,'' Omar  said, but added he would ``regret'' any court-ordered delay.
