Summary for topic d31022t:
``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween  revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring  about 180. The fire  was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people  died in the town of Boraas. At a news conference Friday morning,  police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases. Goteborg is about  500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm. The dance apparently was attended mostly by immigrants or children  of immigrant.
