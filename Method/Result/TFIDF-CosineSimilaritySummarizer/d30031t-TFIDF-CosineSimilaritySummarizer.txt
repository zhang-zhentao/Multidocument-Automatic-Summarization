The two station pieces are so  big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined  mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her crewmates were going to  have to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather  than direct line of sight. Such a ``blind'' docking had never been  attempted before. Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time  for the tasks.
