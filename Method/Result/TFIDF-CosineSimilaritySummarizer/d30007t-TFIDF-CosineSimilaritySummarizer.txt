Summary for topic d30007t:
These reports could not be confirmed independently either. The rebels _  ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's  army and opposition politicians _ took up arms Aug. 2 accusing Kabila  of mismanagement, corruption and creating division among Congo's 400  tribes. There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims. So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate  with the rebels, accusing them of being the puppets of neighboring  Rwanda and Uganda. The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they  were forced to retreat from the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa,  after troops from Angola and Zimbabwe came to Kabila's aid.
