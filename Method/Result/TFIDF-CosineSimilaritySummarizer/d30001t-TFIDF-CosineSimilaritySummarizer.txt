Summary for topic d30001t:
The  agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president  of the National Assembly. Hun Sen's  Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in  July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form  a government on its own. Opposition leaders Prince Norodom  Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition  figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not  negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence  in Beijing. Both Ranariddh and  Sam Rainsy have been outside the country since parliament was ceremonially  opened on Sep. 24.
