Turkey has asked for his extradition  and Ocalan has asked for political asylum.

Foreign Minister Ismail Cem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a meeting  of European defense and foreign ministers, saying he would tell Italian  Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini that ``we expect a serious and fair  approach.''
