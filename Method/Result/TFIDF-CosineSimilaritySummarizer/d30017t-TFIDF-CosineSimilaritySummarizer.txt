North Korea needs a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million tons of grain  to feed its 23 million people, but managed last year to harvest just  2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program  said. The Korean states were  separated into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945. Three years of floods and drought that started in 1995 devastated  North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, already teetering  from the loss of its Soviet bloc trading partners. According to a recent WFP survey, 49 percent  of Cambodian children under age 5 are stunted by lack of food and  20 percent suffer from acute malnutrition.
