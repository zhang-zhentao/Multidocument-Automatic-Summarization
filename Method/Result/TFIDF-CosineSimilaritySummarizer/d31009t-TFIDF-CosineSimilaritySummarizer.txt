ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday faced  intense pressure to step down after allegations that he interfered  in a privatization contract and helped a businessman linked to a mobster  secure loans. Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party  whose backing in parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said  he would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately. Demirel could then choose  any member of parliament to head the government until elections in  April. Two opposition parties threatened to press for a motion to censure  the government.
