``Mr. Livingston's resignation was wrong,'' declared Rep.  Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``It is a surrender to a developing sexual  McCarthyism. But he attempted to draw a contrast with  the allegations against the president, asserting: ``I want to assure  everyone that these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff  and I have never been asked to testify under oath about them.'' The president  is charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of  power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions. In  its report on the internet Thursday night, Rollcall did not disclose  its source but made an oblique reference to Hustler, the sex magazine.
