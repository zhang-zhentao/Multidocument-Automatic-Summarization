Summary for topic d30029t:
The Australian  Navy has sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking  equipment to search the area and may send the frigate HMAS Newcastle  into the area Monday morning morning from Sydney. Sayonara's  rivals are expected to be last year's line honors winner Brindabella  of Sydney and new Australian maxi Wild Thing. Neither organization was able to say how the sailors  died or give details on the injuries suffered by surviving crewmen. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority  (AMSA) said it had alerted all shipping in the Strait as high winds  and huge seas smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet. ``It's  supposition,'' Campbell said.
