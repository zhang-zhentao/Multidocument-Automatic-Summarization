Summary for topic d31026t:
The Padres set an attendance record of 2,555,901 this season, up a  half-million from last year and nearly a million and a half from three  years ago. The Yankees could use a contribution from Jorge  Posada, who will start in Games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive  pitches low in the strike zone, where he can hit with power. Bedecked in bunting  and banners, the revered ballpark always elevates the game with its  aura of history and accomplishment. Knoblauch had argued with the umpire while the go ahead  run scored from first and the Indians won, 4-1. Members of the Yankees indicated  Friday that they, too, thought the call was wrong. They really liked him.
