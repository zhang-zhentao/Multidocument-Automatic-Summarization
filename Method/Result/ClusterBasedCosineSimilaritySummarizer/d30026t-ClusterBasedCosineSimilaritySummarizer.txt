Summary for topic d30026t:
America Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace  largely by appealing to families with chatty teen-agers who want to  flirt online and adults looking for an easy way to send electronic  mail while checking the weather and sports scores. While under investigation, Microsoft  has handed over to the government an estimated 30 million documents,  mostly e-mail. The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, to a striking  degree, are legal campaigns waged with electronic messages. On the stand or  in videotaped testimony, the people being questioned shrug, mumble  and forget. Broader  averages also climbed. Gett said.
