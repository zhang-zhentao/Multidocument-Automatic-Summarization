Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves  as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official  Syrian newspaper said Saturday. Syrian-Israel peace talks broke off more than  two years ago. Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Netanyahu  has sent ``a clear message to all those who are deluding themselves  _ and betting on Israel (to) change its anti-peace stand _ to give  up their illusions,'' the paper said. Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached  an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights,  which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. 2 post.
