Summary for topic d30006t:
It's as if they've  ingested something that has to pass. Unfortunately,  the union leadership has been unwilling to give any serious consideration  to what we have offered.'' ``It only means they have  to pay some 200 players, and they've indicated to us their intent  to file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in  order to avoid payment. The president of the union is  Ewing, who one day commands players to boycott the world championships  because the NBA's corporate fingerprints are on them, then the next  day helps himself to some television commentary work for David Stern's  women's annex. We want to reach an agreement. It's  not on us.
