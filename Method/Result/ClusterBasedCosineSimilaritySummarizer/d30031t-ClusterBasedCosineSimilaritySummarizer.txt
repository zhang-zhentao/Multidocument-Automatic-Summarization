Summary for topic d30031t:
The bigger worry, by  far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling  with Unity. It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time  for the tasks. Once she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters,  and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for  the docking mechanisms on the two station components to snap together. The smaller gap would have been ``probably a little  too close for comfort,'' Mission Control said. It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. Such a ``blind'' docking had never been  attempted before.
