Summary for topic d30047t:
The bigger worry, by  far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling  with Unity. It will serve as an orbital home  for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for up to 20 years. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve  as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. Its control system  consists of 36 thrusters and two large engines for major orbital changes. It is due to be completed by 2004. It will consist of more than 100 elements that  will take 45 assembly flights to complete. It will serve as a space tugboat in the  early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and communications. ``That's terrific.''
