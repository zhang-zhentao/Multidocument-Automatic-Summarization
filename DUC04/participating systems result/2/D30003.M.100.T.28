In 1997, seven years after Pinochet left power, Spain was the biggest single investor in Chile, followed closely by Britain.
Meanwhile, a Chilean television station reported Friday that a Chilean army officer close to Pinochet told the former military chief about his situation after flying to London Thursday.
His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite the general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982.
