Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witnesses at the Microsoft trial.
For AOL, the Netscape purchase would accelerate its evolution toward the Internet.
Microsoft bundled its browser into its industry-standard Windows operating system, and gave away the browser for free.
Yet America Online has also changed in the last couple of years, moving well beyond its reputation as an online service for beginners.
Now in the corridors outside the antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain that Netscape has found a new partner in America Online and has no need of protection from the government.
