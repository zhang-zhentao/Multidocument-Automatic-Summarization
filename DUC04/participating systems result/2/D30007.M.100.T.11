If the rebels succeed in capturing Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel headquarters, this will remove the last government stronghold in eastern Congo and pave the way for rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest.
After trekking several hundred kilometers (miles) through dense tropical forest, thousands of rebel fighters have gathered 19 kilometers (11 miles) outside Kindu, where troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila have used an air base as a launching pad for offensives.
