The leader of the Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urged Yilmaz to resign.
Parliament convened Thursday to vote on whether to move toward a no-confidence motion that could bring down the government over an organized crime scandal.
Mrs. Ciller has not said if she would back an Ecevit-led government and her long-standing rivalry with Yilmaz makes Ecevit's job of coalition-building difficult.
Ecevit, a veteran leftist, was called on to form a cabinet over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed in a no-confidence vote in Parliament.
