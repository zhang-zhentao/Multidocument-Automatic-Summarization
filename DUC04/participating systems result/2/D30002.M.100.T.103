The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing at least 2,000 people.
At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former- hurricane Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.
Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like like a ripsaw Thursday, its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands and mainland communities.
