Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest in London of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, calling it a case of `` international meddling.
The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain.
A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil.
Chilean officials, meanwhile, issued strong protests and sent a delegation to London on Sunday to argue for Pinochet's release.
