Police and soldiers on Friday blocked off the street in front of a house where members of a terrorist gang are believed to have assembled the bomb that blew up the U.S. Embassy, killing 11 people.
But the indictment gives few details of bin Laden's alleged involvement in the embassy attacks.
Ms. White said bin Laden was charged with "plotting and carrying out the most heinous acts of international terrorism and murder." The Taliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not be extradited.
The blast at the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of them Americans, and injured 5,400.
Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan.
