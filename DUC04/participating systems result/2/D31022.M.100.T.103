A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish was the first word that authorities got of a fire racing through a dance hall crowded with immigrant teen- agers, delaying fire squads' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162, officials said Saturday.
A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen- age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180 in Sweden's second- largest city.
The worst previous Swedish fire disaster in modern history was in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire.
