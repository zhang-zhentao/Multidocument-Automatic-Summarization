A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said.
Mourners bearing flowers and candles gathered Sunday outside the house on Griboyedova Canal where a Russian legislator, Galina Staravoitova, was shot to death on Friday night.
