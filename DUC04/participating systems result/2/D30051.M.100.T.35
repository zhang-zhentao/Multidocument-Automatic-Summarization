The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted three underlings in the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities.
In entering those guilty pleas, Jelisic told the tribunal he wanted to "cleanse my soul." To his Muslim targets, Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic was "the face of genocide" who once bragged that "he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee." American and allied forces in Bosnia on Wednesday arrested a Bosnian Serb general who was charged with genocide by the international war crimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment.
