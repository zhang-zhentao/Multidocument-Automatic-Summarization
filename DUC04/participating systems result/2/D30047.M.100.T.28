Russian space experts were making final preparations Thursday at the Baikonur rocket base to launch the first component of a multibillion dollar international space station after a year of delay.
``Now we only have 44 launches to go, about 1,000 hours of space walks and countless problems, but because of the trust and mutual respect...
the international space station is going to be a reality,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference after the launch.
The launching was witnessed by the heads of the space agencies of the 16 nations that are sponsoring the station, which will cost at least $40 billion to build over the next five years .
