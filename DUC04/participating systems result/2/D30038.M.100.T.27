The controversy centers on the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid committee which won the right to stage the 2002 games.
Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractices in the bid campaigns for the games of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002.
Sports Nippon, a leading Japanese sports newspaper, said more than 2 billion yen (dlrs 17 million) of the money Nagano spent to bring the games there has not been accounted for.
