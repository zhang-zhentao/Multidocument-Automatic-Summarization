The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
Administration officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors with leading a global war against U.S. interests.
Under Taliban rules women may not study or work outside their houses, and all kinds of light entertainment including music are banned.
