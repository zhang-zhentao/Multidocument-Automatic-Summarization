U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden.
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group backed by Laden, the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on Afghanistan was to kill Laden and as many of his lieutenants as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.
