Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground.
Agriculture Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said crucial grain, citrus and banana crops had been damaged ``and the economic future of Honduras is uncertain''.
France said it was sending 250 rescue workers to Central America, along with a ship loaded with construction material and equipment.
