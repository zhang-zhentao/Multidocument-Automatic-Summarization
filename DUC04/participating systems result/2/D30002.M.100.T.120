At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.
Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) area below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua.
Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the thousands who are suffering.
