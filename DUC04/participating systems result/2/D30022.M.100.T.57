On Wednesday, 190 dissidents from around the country demanded in an open letter that the government release Xu, Qin and Wang Youcai, saying the arrests run counter to U.N. human rights treaties China has signed over the past 14 months.
``We call on the Chinese government to assure the protection in these cases of Mr. Xu and Mr. Qin''.
