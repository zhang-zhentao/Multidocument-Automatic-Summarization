After an initial lightning advance in the far west of Africa's third-largest nation, the rebels were stopped at the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who are backing Kabila.
The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, after troops from Angola and Zimbabwe came to Kabila's aid.
Troops moving south from Kisangani, the largest city under rebel control, and moving west, had made steady gains against Kindu, which the government apparently used to build up force for a planned counter-offensive.
