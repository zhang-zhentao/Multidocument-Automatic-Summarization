The Yugoslav army mined Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Albania, ensuring that few refugees could escape and limiting routes for arms supplies for the rebels.
The head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, on Monday urged Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a NATO attack.
Holbrooke said he would tell Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of "the extreme gravity of the situation." Following his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a statement denouncing NATO threats as a "criminal act" which favored separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
But Slobodan Milosevic showed no signs of backing down.
