Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompted doubts about his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis, in which Russia has been leading a campaign to forestall airstrikes.
Yeltsin insists he has no major illness and plans to serve out the remaining two years of his term.
Communists and other Yeltsin opponents in parliament's lower house, the State Duma, disagreed and appealed to the Constitutional Court in February.
The call for Yeltsin to step down was backed by many participants in a nationwide labor action earlier this month that attracted about 1 million people.
