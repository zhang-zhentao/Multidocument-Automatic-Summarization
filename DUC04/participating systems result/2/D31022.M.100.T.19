A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180 in Sweden's second-largest city.
Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire.
Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m.
Police rescued 40, and recovered 59 bodies.
The 60th victim died at a hospital.
The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the two-story building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber''.
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the upper floor.
