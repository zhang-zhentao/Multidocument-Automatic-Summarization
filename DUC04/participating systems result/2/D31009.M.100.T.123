Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small, center-left Republican Party, which usually gives him the majority he needs in parliament, votes against him.
Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party whose backing in parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said he would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately.
He denies the charges.
Deputies accused Yilmaz, who has since been serving as acting premier, of entertaining ties with the mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank.
Yilmaz is now acting premier.
Erez opened talks with various party leaders on Monday.
