After first suggesting that the former deputy prime minister had beaten himself on the face, neck and arms during 10 days in police custody, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called for an investigation of the wounds Anwar displayed in court Tuesday and Wednesday.
But there has been no one as high-profile as Anwar.
Mahathir and Anwar had differed over economic policy and Anwar says Mahathir feared him as an alternative leader.
Earlier this week, Anwar appeared in court with a black eye and bruises on his neck and arms.
Anwar is a charismatic politician who was once picked to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
