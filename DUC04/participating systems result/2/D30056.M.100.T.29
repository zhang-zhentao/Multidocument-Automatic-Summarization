Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any progress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
Chechen security forces were still searching today for the bodies.
A French United Nations official who was kidnapped in southern Russia more than 10 months ago was set free Saturday and flown to U.N. headquarters in Geneva.
