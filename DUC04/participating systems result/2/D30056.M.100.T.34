Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news reports said.
The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
It was unclear where Cochetel was held, in the breakaway republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia.
Chechen security forces are still searching for the men's bodies.
Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings and was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also released Saturday, Interfax said.
