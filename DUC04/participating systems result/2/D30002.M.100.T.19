The Honduran president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's central coast.
He urged the more than 1.5 million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery effort.
Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground.
El Salvador's National Emergency Committee listed 174 dead, 96 missing and 27,000 homeless.
