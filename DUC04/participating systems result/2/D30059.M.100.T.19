Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked in an apartment building along with her aide, Ruslan Linkov, the Interfax news agency reported.
A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg in the Russian legislature.
Although it was still not clear who killed Starovoitova or why, the killing had all the earmarkings of a contract hit _ a remarkably common crime in post-Soviet Russia.
Yeltsin, calling her ``my comrade,'' declared that he would personally oversee the investigation into her death.
