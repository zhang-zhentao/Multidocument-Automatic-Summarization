Erez took over efforts to form a government last week after veteran leftist Bulent Ecevit gave up, unable to convince Turkey's bickering center- left and center- right parties to join him in a coalition that excluded the Islamic- oriented party.
Premier- designate Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two- center right parties to hammer together a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller, the ex- premier who commands 99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him Wednesday.
" It is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence," former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks with Demirel.
