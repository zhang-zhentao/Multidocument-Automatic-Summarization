Mahathir and Anwar had differed over economic policy and Anwar says Mahathir feared him as an alternative leader.
" Anwar, 51, was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention without trial, after two weeks of rallies around Malaysia at which he called for government reform and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation.
Last month, Mahathir dismissed and arrested his deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accusing him of corruption and illegal sex acts.
