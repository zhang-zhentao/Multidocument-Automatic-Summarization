The institution exploring apartheid's horrors will issue a report that finds the African National Congress shares blame for human rights violations as it struggled to overcome white rule.
Publicly, the party has long defended its actions as those committed during a "just war." Facing a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W. de Klerk, in illegal acts.
The Commission finds further that Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela herself was responsible for committing such gross violations of human rights.
