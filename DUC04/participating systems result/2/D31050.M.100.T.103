Beijing police Sunday detained one of Xu's China Democracy Party colleagues, Zha Jianguo, to prevent him from attending the trial, Xu's wife said.
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D- Calif., who has long been among China's harshest critics in Congress, said the prison sentences handed out to Xu and Wang were" the clearest demonstration" since the president's visit to China last summer of Beijing's" true intentions regarding human rights.
The dissidents_ Xu Wenli, who was sentenced Monday to 13 years in prison, Wang Youcai, who received an 11-year sentence, and Qin Yongming, who was reported to have received 12 years were charged with subversion.
