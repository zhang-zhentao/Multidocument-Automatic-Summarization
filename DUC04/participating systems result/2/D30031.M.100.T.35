The shuttle and its crew of six snared the Russian-made Zarya control module after chasing it around the Earth in ever-closing orbits throughout the day.
The astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian space station piece and attach it to Unity.
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.
It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched.
It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit.
