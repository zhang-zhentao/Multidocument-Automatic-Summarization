By one vote, a defector from its own ranks, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government since World War II, lost a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies.
Prodi immediately offered his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who asked him to stay on as caretaker premier while the head of state decides whether to call early elections or ask someone else to be premier.
Three days after the collapse of Premier Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling in political leaders to try to reach a consensus on a new government.
Scalfaro has named Prodi as caretaker premier for the interim.
