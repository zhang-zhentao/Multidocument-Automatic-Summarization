Russia stepped up its warnings against such action and dispatched its foreign and defense ministers on an unusually high-level mission to see the Yugoslav president in Belgrade.
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two weeks ago.
Holbrooke said he will explain the "extreme gravity of the situation" when he meets Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later.
The American envoy Holbrooke met with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia night and according to American diplomats told him that he had to take further steps to pull back his military in Kosovo Province or face a NATO attack.
