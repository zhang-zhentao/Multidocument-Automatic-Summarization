Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said on Israeli television that the invitation for a Clinton visit came from Israel and was "warmly welcomed" by the Palestinians.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat of "making a farce" of the Wye River accords and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence.
"The Palestinians are making a farce out of the Wye River accord.
That's the only way we'll get a real peace between Israel and the Palestinians," Netanyahu said.
Israel and the Palestinians have also accused each other of violating other elements of the Wye agreement.
