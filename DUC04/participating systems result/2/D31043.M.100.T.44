Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of President Emile Lahoud as president, said Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new Cabinet.
Parliament on Thursday formally elected Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.
Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more power as a new government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated by the possible departure of the billionaire businessman could affect Lebanon's economic recovery.
