The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face charges of genocide.
In London, police guards were deployed Sunday outside the London Clinic, where Pinochet is believed to still be a patient.
The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at a Spanish magistrate's request.
In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyers for the former strongman went to court Friday to argue that British police acted illegally in accepting the Spanish warrant.
They also maintained that as a former head of state, the general had diplomatic immunity for actions taken while in office.
