Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia in New York last week following reports of a massacre of dozens of East Timorese rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian troops.
``A definitive solution to the East Timor question will not be possible without free consultation to establish the real will of the East Timorese people,'' the 15 EU leaders said in statement after their year-end summit.
Yet Marker, who is visiting Indonesia to promote a U.N.-designed blueprint for autonomy in the former Portuguese colony, said Monday that both sides in the bitter conflict were displaying a newfound taste for compromise.
