However, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday that the Kosovo situation remains critical despite a lull in fighting and the removal of some Yugoslav tanks and troops.
Following his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a statement denouncing NATO threats as a ` criminal act'.
Holbrooke said he will explain the ` extreme gravity of the situation' when he meets Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday.
` We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation.' Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium, en route to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic.
