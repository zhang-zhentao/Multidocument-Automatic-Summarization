Apart from Kindu, Ngangura said rebel fighters took Buta, 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Kisangani and on the main road in northern Congo that links Sudan and the Central African Republic.
Alexis Tambwe Mwamba, one of rebel leaders, said from the rebel stronghold at Goma, 380 kilometers (235 miles) northeast of Kalima, that fighters had intercepted government radio messages in Kindu and knew in advance of the arrival of the aircraft.
