The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday.
The videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president, showed hostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been sent to Chechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the breakaway republic.
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov will allow British government agents to come to Chechnya to investigate the killing, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
