For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight.
In all, three spacewalks are planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical connections between the two modules but to install handrails and other tools for future crews.
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station.
Aboard Endeavour is an American-made connecting passageway named Unity.
The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000 -pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module
