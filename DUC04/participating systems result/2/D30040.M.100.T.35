As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would open Sunday.
It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at the airport.
Israel, which will oversee security at the airport, has forbidden its own citizens from using the airport initially, Israel's Channel 2 TV said.
An Egypt Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in the southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m.
The Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
