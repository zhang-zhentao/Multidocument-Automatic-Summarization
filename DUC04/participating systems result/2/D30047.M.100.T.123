The shuttle crew will attach the two modules together in three space walks, using the Endeavors robot arm.
Space officials from 16 nations taking part in the project cheered as the rocket soared into the cloudy sky above the central Asian steppe from the Baikonur launch pad Friday _ a year later than planned.
The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early 2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to blast off next July or August.
