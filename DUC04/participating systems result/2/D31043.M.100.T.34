The commander of Lebanon's army will become the country's next president after winning the crucial backing of Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon.
According to the constitution, a president must begin his term by appointing the prime minister and a Cabinet through a decree issued after consulting with Parliament members.
There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing Hariri as prime minister.
The dispute appears to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how Lebanon will be governed during Lahoud's six-year term.
Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency.
