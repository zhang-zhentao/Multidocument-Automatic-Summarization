tripoli, Libya (AP) U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing two suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be secured in the ``not too distant future''.
With the mournful lament of bagpipes and prayers of healing, the people of Lockerbie paid tribute to the 270 people killed when a bomb brought Pan Am Flight 103 crashing down on this tiny town 10 years ago Monday.
