Russia's new prime minister picked an unusual way to reassure the nation Thursday.
Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew to Washington on Friday for negotiations with the IMF over the dlrs 4.3 billion installment.
But Primakov said that the country's plan would be dependent on the IMF loan, not the other way around.
He said there was no need to regulate the influx of dollars into Russia, but the government should take steps to prevent what he called ``the dollar drain''.
