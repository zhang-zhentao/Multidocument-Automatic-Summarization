The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a "gas chamber." A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180.
"It was a panic," Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure Friday evening.
In 1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
