Yeltsin was suffering from tracheobronchitis, had a fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 Fahrenheit) and was being treated with antibiotics, the president's doctors told the Interfax news agency.
However, Yeltsin's condition was stable, Yakushkin said.
Yakushkin and other aides sought to play down the seriousness of Yeltsin's illness.
Yeltsin has a history of health problems, and underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996.
A respiratory infection forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this week.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating from his latest illness, has canceled a trip to an Asian summit next month, his office said Friday.
