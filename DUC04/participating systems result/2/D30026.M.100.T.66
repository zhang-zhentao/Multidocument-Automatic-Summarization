America Online Inc. wants to become the ``next Microsoft'' in two promising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. is just another company the Internet media business and electronic commerce.
Microsoft Corp. argued in federal court Monday that the proposed acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. by America Online seriously undermined the government's antitrust suit against the software giant.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov.25: America Online's effort to acquire Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun Microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape can change in fast-moving technical fields.
