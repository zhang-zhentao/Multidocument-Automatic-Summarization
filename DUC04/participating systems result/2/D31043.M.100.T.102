Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care- taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, said Hariri turned down down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new Cabinet.
Hariri is still the front- runner to form the next government but Saturday's Daily Star newspaper Saturday's quoted sources as saying that Hariri was" outraged" that only 62 of the 128 members in Parliament declared their support for him during a meeting with Lahoud Friday.
Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.
