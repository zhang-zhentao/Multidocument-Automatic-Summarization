By one vote, a defector from its own ranks, Prime Minister Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government since World War II, lost a confidence vote Friday in the Chamber of Deputies.
The latest threat to the government of Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist Refounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget, imperiling the future of the center-left coalition.
Three days after the collapse of Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling in political leaders Monday to try to reach a consensus on a new government.
