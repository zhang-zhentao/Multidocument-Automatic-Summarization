Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving two yachts missing.
The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center (AusSAR) in Canberra.
The spokesman said no word had been received on the fate of the Winston Churchill or the sailor swept from the deck of Sword of Orion on Sunday night.
The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's winner, Brindabella.
