The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro- independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.
West Timor shares the same island as troubled East Timor, a former Portuguese territory dominated by Roman Catholicism and invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro- independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.
