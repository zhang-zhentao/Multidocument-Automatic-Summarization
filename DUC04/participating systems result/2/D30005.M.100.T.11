Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings.
Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against bin Laden : That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's door by federal authorities - the attacks on American soldiers in Somalia in 1993 and 1994.
