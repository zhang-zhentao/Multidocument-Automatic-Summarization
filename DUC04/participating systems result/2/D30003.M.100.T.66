Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one lawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous.
Margaret Thatcher entertained former Children dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was arrested in his bed in a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's office said Tuesday, amid growing diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move.
The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face charges of genocide.''
