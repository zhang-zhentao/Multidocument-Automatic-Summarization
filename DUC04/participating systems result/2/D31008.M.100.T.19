Friends at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyo., have set up The Matthew Shepard Memorial Fund to raise money to pressure the state legislature to pass anti-hate crime legislation.
Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him.
Although Wyoming often bills itself as the ``equality state,'' in reference to its being the first state to give women the vote, the state legislature has repeatedly voted down hate crime legislation on the grounds that it would give homosexuals special rights.
