Kurds in Italy, Germany, Austria and Romania launched protests and hunger strikes in fervent shows of solidarity with the rebel leader.
He leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
The protest in Rome was peaceful Sunday.
Kurds from across Western Europe have been streaming into Rome to show their support for Ocalan (pronounced Oh-jah-lan), who was arrested Thursday when he stepped off a plane from Moscow.
He had been seeking political asylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout in Syria.
He is viewed in Turkey as a terrorist.
