The rebels accuse Kabila of betraying the eight-month rebellion that brought him to power in May 1997 through mismanagement and creating divisions among Congo's 400 tribes.
The rebels say they now control one-third of Kindu, which the government has used as a staging area for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in the east.
Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
In late 1996, Congolese Tutsis backed by Rwanda attacked the refugee camps, dislodged the Hutu fighters and forced most of the refugees back home across the border.
