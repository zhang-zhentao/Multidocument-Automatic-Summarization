As labor battles go, the current one between the National Basketball Association and its players is weird even by sports standards.
There is a real possibility that most, if not all, of the coming season will be canceled.
In this union battle it is the interests of the best paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating the discussion.
And here it is some of the workers, not the management, who are considering trying to make the union disappear.
The current arrangement has produced an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportions.
Last year more players than ever before received the union minimum, then $242,000 for rookies or $272,000 for veterans.
