Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil consisted of two companies : Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil.
Back when Standard Oil organized its operations by state, Exxon was Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil was Standard Oil of New York.
The boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world's largest oil company, a source close to the negotiations said Friday.
