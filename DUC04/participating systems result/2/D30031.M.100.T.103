Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian- made Zarya control module that had to be connected to to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.
A last- minute alarm forced NASA to halt Thursday's launching of the space shuttle Endeavour, on a mission to start assembling the international space station.
Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris.
