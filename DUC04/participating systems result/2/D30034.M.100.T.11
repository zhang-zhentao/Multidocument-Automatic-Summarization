Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.
The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.
East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, has said that between 30 and 40 people were reportedly killed near the villages of Alas and Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, East Timor capital.
