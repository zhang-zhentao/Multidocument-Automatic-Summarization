Rebel leaders said a victory at Kindu would confirm rebel strength, boost fighters' morale and perhaps persuade others to join them.
But the president has so far refused, accusing the rebels of being puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, which Kabila has accused of orchestrating the rebellion.
The rebels accuse Kabila of betraying the eight-month rebellion that brought him to power in May 1997 through mismanagement and creating divisions among Congo's 400 tribes.
In late 1996, Congolese Tutsis backed by Rwanda attacked the refugee camps, dislodged the Hutu fighters and forced most of the refugees back home across the border.
