Leading maxi yachts Brindabella, Sayonara and Marchioness were locked in a three-way duel down the New South Wales state coast Saturday as the Sydney to Hobart fleet faced deteriorating weather.
With winds gusting to 90 mph (145 kph) and seas swelling to 35 feet (10 meters), the race continued even as rescue teams searched for the missing vessels.
There was no sign of a sailor swept off the Sword of Orion when the 30-foot (9-meter) boat rolled in wild seas Sunday night near Gabo Island, about 280 miles (450 kilometers) east of Melbourne.
A total of 37 yachts have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
