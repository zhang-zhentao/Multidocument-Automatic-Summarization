Prodi had said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked support.
The break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation.
Premier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday for any votes freed up from a split in a far-left party, but said he will resign if he loses a confidence vote expected later this week.
The Communist Refoundation Party provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget.
By only one vote, the center-left prime minister of Italy, Romano Prodi, lost a confidence vote in Parliament Friday and was toppled from power.
