Agreement among the three officials is essential for the smooth running of the government.
There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing Hariri as prime minister.
Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, said Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new Cabinet.
He accused President Emile Lahoud of violating the constitution and demanded that he acknowledge it before he could reconsider his position.
