Less than a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton is to arrive for a visit meant to bolster a new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the two sides exchanged angry accusations Sunday over Jewish settlements and street clashes.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Palestinians were emboldened to foment street riots and threaten to declare statehood because they believed they had the Clinton administration `` in their back pocket.
Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace process forward, which has frustrated Clinton and angered the Palestinians, may not be enough to save his government from collapse next week.
