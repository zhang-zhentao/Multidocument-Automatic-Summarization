White House officials and gay Democrats, concerned that the nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is about to endorse Sen. Alfonse D' Amato for re-election, are intensely lobbying the group to try to shift its support to the Democratic challenger.
Asked if Schumer would raise the issue in a television commercial, Morris responded : An endorsement by the group could prove important in swinging voters to D' Amato in a tight race.
` He promised to be the education governor,' said Ms. Boyle.
For that reason, some White House officials say they think a Human Rights Campaign endorsement of D' Amato will be almost meaningless among gay voters.
