President Clinton will travel to Gaza next month to address Palestinian leaders, the White House said Friday.
Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said on Israeli television that the invitation for a Clinton visit came from Israel and was "warmly welcomed" by the Palestinians.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat of "making a farce" of the Wye River accords and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence.
"The Palestinians are making a farce out of the Wye River accord.
Israel and the Palestinians have also accused each other of violating other elements of the Wye agreement.
