The government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.
According to the government, the informant worked closely with Osama Bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period when prosecutors assert Laden was ordering deadly attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.
U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant of Laden, officials said Saturday.
