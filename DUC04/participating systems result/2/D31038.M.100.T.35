Police and soldiers on Friday blocked off the street in front of a house where members of a terrorist gang are believed to have assembled the bomb that blew up the U.S. Embassy, killing 11 people.
But the indictment gives few details of bin Laden's alleged involvement in the embassy attacks.
The Taliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not be extradited.
Washington blames bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured an estimated 5,000 people.
Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan.
