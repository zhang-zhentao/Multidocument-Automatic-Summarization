Israel's Cabinet decided Friday to suspend indefinitely its ratification of the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
Israel says it should be done by a vote by the Palestine National Council.
One of Israel's key demands is that the Palestinians do more to fight attacks by Islamic militants against Israeli targets.
Their car-bomb blew apart two hours later in a Jerusalem market, killing both men and wounding 24 people.
Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem that killed the two assailants and injured 21 Israelis.
The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility.
