IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund _ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _ amounted to a ``bribe''.
It's the most serious case of alleged ethical misconduct investigated by the IOC since former U.S. member Robert Helmick was accused of conflict of interest in 1991.
>From 1991 to 1995, the committee _ under the direction of Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa.
