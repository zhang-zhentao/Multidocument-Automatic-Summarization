Last Saturday morning, while Matthew Shepard lay comatose from a beating, a college homecoming parade passed a few blocks from his hospital bed in Fort Collins.
As a gay college student lay hospitalized in critical condition after a severe beating here, this small city, which bills itself as `` Wyoming's hometown,'' wrestled with its attitudes towards gay men.
Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five days after he was found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures.
