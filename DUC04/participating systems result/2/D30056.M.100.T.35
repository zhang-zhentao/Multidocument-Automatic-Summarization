The severed heads of the four hostages were found lined up Tuesday along a highway outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny.
Assailants have abducted Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, officials said Friday.
Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news reports said.
It was unclear where Cochetel was held, in the breakaway republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia.
Chechen security forces are still searching for the men's bodies.
Cochetel was unharmed, but he said three of the kidnappers had been killed.
