A Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast faces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder and leader.
Better known as Apo, Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, in 1978.
Turkish authorities negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a second day Monday to secure the release of an Italian inmate held hostage to pressure Italy into extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, a prosecutor said.
Monday, D'Alema said he would not bow to pressure.
The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader Ocalan prompted widespread protests by Kurds throughout Europe.
Turkey has asked for Ocalan to be returned to Turkey.
