Chilean officials, meanwhile, issued strong protests and sent a delegation to London on Sunday to argue for Pinochet's release.
``She regarded it as a private meeting,'' said Mark Worthington, spokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister from 1979-90.
In Chile, the detention triggered both celebrations by relatives of victims of Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime and protests from the retired general's supporters.
Pinochet, 82, had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a painful spinal disorder which had hindered his movement.
