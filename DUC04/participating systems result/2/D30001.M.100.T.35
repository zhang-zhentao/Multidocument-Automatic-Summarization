Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demands for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to "internationalize" the political crisis.
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that Hun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread fraud.
Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location.
The opposition organized protests in Phnom Penh seeking Hun Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed.
Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament from his party have been holed up overseas for two months.
