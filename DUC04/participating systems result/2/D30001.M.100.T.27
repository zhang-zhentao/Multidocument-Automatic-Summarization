King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.
In a long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 64 seats in the 122-member chamber.
In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied to all politicians.
