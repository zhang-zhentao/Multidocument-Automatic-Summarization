Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics opposi= tion leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of security gu= arantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote in a letter to K= ing Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the first session of the= new National Assembly on Nov. 25 but complained that Hun Sen's assurance= s were not strong enough to ease concerns his party members may be arrest= ed upon their return to Cambodia.
Cambodia's two-party opposition asked t= he Asian Development Bank Monday to stop providing loans to the incumbent= government which it calls illegal.
