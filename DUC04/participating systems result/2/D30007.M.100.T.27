Rebel commanders said Tuesday they were poised to overrun an important government-held air base in eastern Congo _ a battle that could determine the future of the two-month Congolese war.
Alexis Tambwe Mwamba, one of rebel leaders, said from the rebel stronghold at Goma, 380 kilometers (235 miles) northeast of Kalima, that fighters had intercepted government radio messages in Kindu and knew in advance of the arrival of the aircraft.
A day after shooting down a jetliner, Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies pushed Sunday through government defense lines, showing the confidence of a victor in a week-old battle for a strategic air base.
