Chilean officials, meanwhile, issued strong protests and sent a delegation to London on Sunday to argue for Pinochet's release.
The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain.
Pinochet was detained in the London clinic while recovering from back surgery.
In London, where Pinochet has been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx of British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the arrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general, 82, is not a Spanish citizen.
