TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
The sanctions ban flights to and from the country.
On Sunday, state-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official in the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, which is the equivalent of a foreign ministry, as saying that ``a solution to this crisis is within reach''.
He credited Annan's talks with Omar al-Muntasser, Libya's foreign minister, who met with A/\002.
The Libyan leader last visited Tunisia in January 1996, when he met Ban Ali in the southern town of Medenine.
