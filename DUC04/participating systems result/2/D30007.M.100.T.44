After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances.
Etienne Ngangura said the rebel fighters were inside Kindu and had taken the adjacent, large airbase, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel stronghold.
Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the Elila River bridge, died down after the rebels fired a barrage of artillery into the government-held quarters and the air base, four kilometers (two miles) away.
