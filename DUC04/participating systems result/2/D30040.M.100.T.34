It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at the airport.
An Egypt Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in the southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza and Israel is to open next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a Palestinian seaport in Gaza are continuing.
The Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
The plane left with the passenger aboard, but without his luggage.
Israeli airport security officials were not available for comment.
