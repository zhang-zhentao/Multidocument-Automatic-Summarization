The boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world's largest oil company, a source close to the negotiations said Friday.
Oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news of continuing talks between Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would create the world's largest oil company.
The reported talks between Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that of Wal-Mart and General Electric, and Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, come as oil prices have sunk to their lowest in almost 12 years.
