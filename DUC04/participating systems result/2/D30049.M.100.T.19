President Clinton made an unusual, direct appeal to North Korea on Saturday to set aside any nuclear ambitions in favor of strengthening ties to South Korea and the United States.
Before leaving Washington for this five-day trip to Japan, Korea and Guam, he drew a parallel between the governments of Iraq and North Korea, saying, ``We must be no less concerned by North Korea's weapons activities''.
The Clinton administration is urgently seeking to inspect a vast constructiW\005.
Although they have not explained exactly why the government is building the complex, North Korean officials have denied that it would be used to develop nuclear weapons.
