Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who was to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an off-year election.
The soul-searching and recriminations and a possibility of congressional leadership challenges came as election results showed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45 hold over the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seats in the House.
Fury at the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday's elections, when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the House.
