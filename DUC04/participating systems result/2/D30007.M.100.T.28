Rebel commanders said Tuesday they were poised to overrun an important government-held air base in eastern Congo _ a battle that could determine the future of the two-month Congolese war.
The bloody bandages of injured rebels trucked back to this rear base Wednesday offered evidence that the three-day battle for the strategic air base at Kindu was not going well for those fighting to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
A day after shooting down a jetliner, Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies pushed Sunday through government defense lines, showing the confidence of a victor in a week-old battle for a strategic air base.
