Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return home Monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said.
The president insists he has no major health problems and will serve out the remaining two years of his term.
President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday, nursing a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a foreign trip and revived concerns about his ability to govern.
However, Yeltsin's condition was stable, Yakushkin said.
Yeltsin has a history of health problems, and underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996.
