Sharon's appointment would signal a toughening of Israel's positions and could further strain relations with Arab neighbors.
Ariel Sharon has a law degree, and fancies himself a farmer.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians.
An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by pro-Israeli Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps.
In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers denounced the appointment as a "disaster" for peace.
