Turkey has been trying to form a new government since a coalition government led by Yilmaz collapsed last month over allegations that he rigged the sale of a bank.
Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government.
Ecevit must now try to build a government.
Demirel consulted Turkey's party leaders immediately after Ecevit gave up.
By tradition, Demirel should then have asked the leader of Parliament's largest party to form a new government.
Yilmaz led the last government.
Ecevit already has the support of her arch-rival, outgoing Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head of the other center-right party.
Or Demirel
