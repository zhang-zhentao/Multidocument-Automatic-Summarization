Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
Annan's one-day visit to meet with Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects.
Qatar's foreign minister, Sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani, met Gadhafi in the desert on Saturday, Libya's official television reported.
Gadhafi began a surprise visit to neighboring Tunisia on Monday, his first known trip since injuring his hip in July.
