The U.S. delegation, led by Charles Kartman, President Clinton's special envoy on North Korean issues, left Pyongyang on Wednesday after 12 hours of negotiations over three days with a team from the North Korean Foreign Ministry.
But he said the North risks closing the door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. inspection of the site.
That deal would be shattered if the suspect site turned out to be a clandestine nuclear project.
The North Koreans have denied that the complex is intended to help build nuclear weapons.
