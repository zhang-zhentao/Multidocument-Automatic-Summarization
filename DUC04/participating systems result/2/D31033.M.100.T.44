A federal judge Friday pushed back the starting date of the antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp. by four days, to Oct. 19, while also ordering the company to comply with the Justice Department's request to examine Microsoft's financial records.
Microsoft Corp. has said that material in an unpublished book by two business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week.
