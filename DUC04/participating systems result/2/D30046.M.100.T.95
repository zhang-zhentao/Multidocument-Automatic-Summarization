House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of shock = to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday night as = the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues th= at he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past.
The smart money shou= ts that President Clinton will never resign and he concurs.
In a few shor= t days we have managed to make the terms ``surreal '' ``bizarre '' ``spli= t-screen America '' ``shocking '' ``runaway train'' and ``politics of per= sonal destruction'' useless cliches.
Bob Livingston couldn't have been cl= earer about that.
