Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating from his latest illness, has canceled a trip to an Asian summit next month, his office said Friday.
Government sources said the president has also called off a visit to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin said those plans were still going forward.
Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis.
Yeltsin's doctors have pronounced his health `` more or less normal,'' his wife Naina said in an interview published Wednesday.
